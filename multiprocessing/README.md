Multiprocessing in C

In this code, we generate random strings and use several concurrent processes to encrypt these strings in parallel and save the results to an outputfile


To run the code, simply run 
```make && ./main <run_name>```

where <run_name> is replaced with a unique name for the current run to assure that the output files generated do not overwrite previous runs.
This will run the main program.

To run the test cases, simply run 
```make && ./test```
